# Final website for CS401

Name: Zarek Sliwoski
Email: zareksliwoski@u.boisestate.edu

## How to run this website
- run the database_setup.sql file to setup the database
- npm install
- node ./bin/www

Browse to localhost:3000
Begin using the site, creating and updating blog records

## Bugs
User is able to post empty titled entries
User is able to post entries without content
User has static authentication with the database.

## Features

This application features standard CRUD features written in javascript. It utilizes a MySQL back-end database and
supports api functionality written through node.

It utilizes the provided ".pug" template framework, and
boils down to standard reusable html.

## Future Improvements

This app could be improved by providing additional styling as well as a way to create new users with their own blog posts. I think a good next improvement would see a user bio as well as a profile image.

Hopefully this provides a solid basis moving forward for future site ideas/projects.
